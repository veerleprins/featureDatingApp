# Filter feature dating application

This schoolproject consists of creating a feature for an online dating application. Within the project, it was decided to create a **filter** feature. Later in the project there is a collaboration with other students to add other features to a fully functioning dating app. To read the entire process of creating this filter feature and creating the functioning dating application, you can go to my [wiki](https://github.com/veerleprins/featureDatingApp/wiki).

## Needed for this feature:
- Code editor
- Node.js
- knowledge of JavaScript
- knowledge of HTML & CSS
- little bit of knowledge of command line

## Getting started
To start, you must have a *code editor* installed on your computer. For this project (and most of my projects) I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). But you can also use [Atom](https://atom.io/), for example.

Then you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). To know if node is installed on your computer, you can open the terminal or command prompt and enter the next code:

``` node -v ```

If node has been successfully installed, with this line of code you will get the installed node version that is on your computer.

The last step before getting started is to download this project and open it with your code editor.
