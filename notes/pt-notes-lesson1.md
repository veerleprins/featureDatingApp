Project Tech is the first stepping stone to become a *well-rounded web developer*.<br>
Building a *prototype of a dynamic web application*.

:dart: **Goal:**<br>
Design and building a working protoype (front-end & back-end) of a dating site based on HTML / CSS / JavaScript / Node.js / MongoDB

## :bulb: Learning: 
1. **Design** a part of a dynamic web application.
2. **Research** current topics in web dev. (like: version control, code style & standards, local development setup etc.)
3. **Collaborate** with other developers (version control with github, code standards & style and document the project).
4. **Recognise** good quality code and **review** other people's code.

## :exclamation: Deliverables:
- **Individual Prototype:** working interactive feature for serious relationships. (60%)
- **Team Prototype:** working interactive dating site for serious relationships. (40%)
- **Process book (wiki):** that provides insight into the weekly iterative process.

-> Assignments can compensate each other.

### Individual assessment:
- **First part:** work individually on your job story, research existing dating apps, sketching & designing the components within the job story and end with a working prototype of your job story.<br>
Meanwhile: researching code standards, code styles, setup local development environment, setup a repository on Github and researching recent developments within the field of web dev.

### Team assessment:
- **Second part:** create a team of 3 students and combine the job stories into a dating app. Use Git and Github for version control. Agree on code standards & style and review code. And document the whole project.

#### Wiki
Create a wiki on Github & add page every week (log your research and design steps)<br>
- Collects research, ideas, sketches, designs, feedback etc.
- Provides insight in the iterative process of testing and collecting feedback.

Serious dating starts at being strangers to each other and grows towards romantic partnership.<br>
In between  a lot of things happen which involve emotions.

The more connected you feel with each other, the more you both are allowed to express emotions.<br>
Great interaction design can help to channel the extremities.
