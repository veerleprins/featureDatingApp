# Notes lesson 4

Two types of databases:
- SQL
- NoSQL

## SQL 
SQL stands for: Structured Query Language and is a language used for managing data held in a *relational* database. SQL databases are like tables and each table has different relationships with other tables. It all works because of the link between the ID's.

## NoSQL
NoSQL stands for: Non SQL or Non relational and provides a mechanism for storage / retrieval of data that is modeled an document-oriented way (like JSON files).

### MongoDB
MongoDB is a example of a NoSQL and is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database. It uses JSON-like documents with schemas.

We're going to work with MongoDB, NoSQL. To start, you need to install the MongoDB:

``` npm install mongodb .env```

Why the .env ? This is a file to 'lock' your password and hostname for others on GitHub.

compass - visual interface for the MongoDB 
atlas - hosted MongoDB
